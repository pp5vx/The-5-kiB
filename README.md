This is an "Accu-Keyer" (WB4VVF) Clone for the Arduino (or ATTiny45 or 85)

* Source: (c)2009 - KC4IFB (Richard) _in_ QEX (ARRL) for Sep/Oct 2009

* I added _Weight Control_, _reformatted_ source, and corrected some _minor_ bugs

There is no **_misteries_** here, it's perfect for an almost **rainy weekend** !

(and works on first attempt, if you **do it carefully** when wiring the pins... LOL)

But, this work is **_licensed_**, as follows:

* Licensed in World (except in Brazil), as: **CC BY-SA-NC 3.0**

* Licensed **only** in Brazil, as: **Â©2017 - PP5VX** ( _Todos os Direitos Reservados_ )

So... Enjoy !
